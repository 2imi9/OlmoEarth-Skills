# Imagery sources — start with S2, add S1 only when it helps

Studio offers three modalities. The default and right answer for most tasks is **Sentinel-2 alone**.

| Source | Available in Studio | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| **Sentinel-2 (optical)** | Yes | 10–60 m multispectral, 5-day revisit, broad spectral range (RGB + NIR + SWIR + red-edge) | Blocked by clouds; no signal at night |
| **Sentinel-1 (radar)** | Yes | Cloud-penetrating, day/night, sensitive to surface roughness, moisture, structure | Speckle noise; spectrum-blind (no color); harder to interpret |
| **Landsat (optical)** | Not yet | Long historical record (Landsat 8: 2013–; thermal band) | 30 m resolution, 16-day revisit, similar cloud limitation to S2 |

## When to add Sentinel-1

Add S1 to S2 only if at least one of these applies:

1. **Cloud cover problem** — task region has >30% annual cloud-cover climatology (tropics, monsoon-affected, polar). S1 fills the gaps.
2. **Texture / structure signal** — the target is detectable by *roughness* not *color*: oil slicks (smooth water = dark), ship wakes (turbulence trail), soil moisture (dielectric constant), water-surface roughness, ice-surface change.
3. **Forest structure or biomass** — radar penetrates canopy; useful for above-ground biomass and forest disturbance.
4. **Night / dark targets** — vessels at night, active fire heat (though Landsat thermal is better).
5. **You've trained S2-only and accuracy plateaued** — S1 is your next dial; add it and re-train.

Don't add S1 because "more bands feels safer". Every added modality:
- Increases training time meaningfully (per Studio's own warning)
- Adds noise that the model has to filter out
- Increases the chance of a temporal alignment issue (S1 and S2 don't pass on the same day)

## When Landsat would help (when it lands in Studio)

- Pre-2015 history (Landsat 8: 2013 onward, Landsat 9: 2021)
- Long-term trend tasks (decadal land-cover change, deforestation history)
- Heat / thermal signals (urban heat islands, fire scars, surface temperature) — Landsat has a thermal band, S2 doesn't
- Cross-sensor consistency: if downstream consumer expects 30 m Landsat data

Until Landsat is available in Studio, route the user to fetch Landsat from Planetary Computer or Google Earth Engine separately and use S2 for the Studio job.

## Per-task quick lookup

| Task | Recommended modalities |
|------|------------------------|
| Crop type | S2 |
| Mangrove extent | S2 (S1 helps in tidal areas) |
| Land cover | S2 |
| Soil moisture | S2 + S1 (S1 is *the* moisture signal) |
| Tree height / canopy | S2 (S1 helps for structure) |
| Biomass | S2 + S1 |
| Vessel detection | S2 + S1 (S1 catches small wakes at night) |
| Solar array detection | S2 (high reflectance is the signal) |
| Oil slick | S1 primary, S2 secondary (slick = smooth water = dark S1) |
| Flood mapping | S2 + S1 (clouds during flood events; S1 essential) |
| Drought indicators | S2 (NDVI, EVI carry the signal) |
| Fire scar / burn area | S2 (SWIR band carries the signal) |
| Active fire detection | S2 (better with thermal — switch to Landsat when available) |
| Wetlands | S2 + S1 |
| Ice / snow extent | S2 (S1 helps for sea ice texture) |
| Embeddings (general purpose) | S2 alone |
| Embeddings (water/wetland clustering) | S2 + S1 |

## Anti-patterns

- **Add S1 without checking if S2 alone solves it** — costs training time you don't need to spend.
- **S1-only for a spectral task** — radar can't see color. Crop type from S1 alone is much harder than from S2.
- **Add S1 because the user said "it's cloudy"** — confirm with cloud-cover climatology numbers, not anecdotes. A region with 40 % monthly cloud cover may still produce a perfectly good seasonal composite from S2.
- **Mix S1 and S2 with a time frame that doesn't match revisit cadence** — S2 has 5-day revisit, S1 ~6-day at mid-latitudes. Mode C with ±12 h may miss one or the other; widen to ±48 h or accept missing pairs.
